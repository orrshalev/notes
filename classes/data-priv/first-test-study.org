* P1
- Re-identification
- k-anonymity, l-diversity
- Composition attack
- Privacy game
- Random variable: \Omega, X, P[X = x]
- Expectation is linear
- Conditional probability
- Posterior vs prior
- Variance
- risk = expectation[loss] = \sum_{threats} loss \times probability[threat]
* P2
- Interactive vs. non-interactive setting
- Randomized algorithm
- Variance is not linear
- Formal definition of DP: (randomized) M is DP if for all solutions in range(M) and for
  all pairs of neighboring datasets, P[M(D_1) \in S]/P[M(D_2) \in S] <= exp(\epsilon) where \epsilon > 0
  and the probability is take over the coin flip of M
- Unbiased: E[M_q(D) - q(D)] = 0, utility = E[|M_q(D) - q(D)|]
- Bayes theorem (slide 20)
- Sensitivity = \Delta q = max_{D, D' \in U}||q(D) - q(D')||_1
- Sensitivity examples (slide 27)
- Laplace mechanism definition notation, maybe pdf?, variance
- (\delta, \epsilon) formula
- A randomized mechanism (\alpha, \beta)-usefulness is useful if with probabily 1 - \beta, |M_q(D) - q(d)| \leq \alpha
- Post-processing invariance
- Group privacy
