*These are mostly wrong*

To make the best use of the former options, limit what is compiled to
the methods that you are interested in.

- =--engine.CompileOnly=foo= restricts compilation to methods with =foo=
  in their name. Use this in combination with returning a value or
  taking parameters to avoid code being compiled away.

- =--engine.CompileImmediately= compiles methods as soon as they are
  run.

- =--engine.BackgroundCompilation=false= compiles synchronously, which
  can simplify things.

- =--compiler.Inlining=false= disables inlining which can make code
  easier to understand.

- =--engine.OSR=false= disables on-stack-replacement (compilation of the
  bodies of =while= loops for example) which can make code easier to
  understand.

- =--engine.Compilation=false= turns off Truffle compilation all
  together.
