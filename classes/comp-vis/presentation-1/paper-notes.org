#+title: Paper Notes

* A Spectral Approach to Item Response Theory
- page 1 and 2 provide some helpful applications related to applications in ranking systems and education
- Page 2 has limitations of current \beta^*_i estimation techniques
- P3 has definition of markov chain and pairwise differential measurement
- Benefit - matrix is sparse so computation can be sped up, error bound, dont go in depth just discuss briefly
- Algorithm in page 4
* Optimal and Private Learning from Human Response Data
- Algorithm in page 6
