Review *Gauss' law for thin sphereical lens*, how cameras work

Focus related to blur

Perspective projection formulas using $f$, perspective foreshortening is $Z_s$ term

Quantization means discretization of brightness values

A digital image has spatial sampling parameters (spatial resoultion, pixel size, pixel density)
and quantization paramters (num bits per pixel, spectral band)

Aliasing is distorition of features as a result of reduced spatial resolution

Patchy images is result of reduced quantization, pseudo-contours appear when continuous objects get quantized
