#+title: 3rd Class

Two /broad/ approaches to image segmentation:
1. Region-based approach - clustering of similar pixels into regions
2. Find bounderies/contours between dissimilar pixels
Most modern algorithms use both.

Going further, we can have /feature extraction/, meaningful descriptions of the entities in the segmented image

Orders of discontinuity? Depends on order of derivative

/High-level vision/ involves using memory to match feature description to that memory (model)

In high level, besides recognizing objeccts in the image, we can establish semantic relationships
(spatio-temporal) between objects (such as above-below)

3 schools of computer vision reserch:
1. Neuro physiology - the physical mechanics
2. Perceptual pshycology - where cognition comes in, underlying psychology of vision and how they interprent them
3. Computer vision algorithms and systems
All build on each other, in course we are focused on 3.

Techniques used in CV:
1. Geometry - describing the 3D world, both imaging (for objects) and scene (for interactions)
2. Physics - scene illumination and reflection, optics of data source such as camera
3. Statistics - description of large data
4. Calculus - measuring changes
5. Graph theory and combinatorics - semantic relationships between items, can be related to topology as well
6. Domain knowledge
